= unix-crypt

== Description

unix-crypt creates and checks passwords that you'd normally find in an /etc/shadow file on your UNIX box.

It's written entirely in Ruby and has no external dependencies.

It handles:
* DES passwords (the standard 13 character password with a 2 character salt)
* MD5 passwords (starting with $1$)
* SHA256 passwords (starting with $5$)
* SHA512 passwords (starting with $6$)

This library is compatible with Ruby 1.8.7 and above.  Tested on Ruby 2.0.0p353.

== Installation

  gem install unix-crypt

== Using the command line tool

An executable named +mkunixcrypt+ allows you to generate passwords from the command line.

  Usage: mkunixcrypt [options]
  Encrypts password using the unix-crypt gem

  Options:
      -h, --hash [HASH]                Set hash algorithm [SHA512 (default), SHA256, MD5, DES]
      -p, --password [PASSWORD]        Provide password on command line (insecure!)
      -s, --salt [SALT]                Provide hash salt
      -r, --rounds [ROUNDS]            Set number of hashing rounds (SHA256/SHA512 only)
          --help                       Show this message
      -v, --version                    Show version

== Using the library

You can either validate a password of any type matches its hash:

  >> require 'unix_crypt'
  => true
  >> UnixCrypt.valid?("Hello world!", "$5$saltstring$5B8vYYiY.CVt1RlTTf8KbXBH3hsxY/GNooZaBBGWEc5")
  => true

Or you can generate a new hash, given a password and salt:

  >> UnixCrypt::SHA256.build("Hello world!", "saltstring")
  => "$5$saltstring$5B8vYYiY.CVt1RlTTf8KbXBH3hsxY/GNooZaBBGWEc5"

If a salt is not specified, one will be generated using random data:

  >> UnixCrypt::SHA256.build("Hello world!")
  => "$5$v.fjb6lucDCZKjcf$90gzpr9HYo0eAeaN8rubElJdUUOcVYjTnGePBRvCgt1"

There are four classes you can use, depending on which hashing algorithm you'd like:

  UnixCrypt::DES
  UnixCrypt::MD5
  UnixCrypt::SHA256
  UnixCrypt::SHA512
